# Corona-Warn-App

NOTE: This README is also available [in German](translations/README.de.md). Thank you for understanding that the German version might not always be up-to-date with the English one.

## About this project
We are developing the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for Germany, called "Corona-Warn-App". This project has the goal to develop a app based on technology with a decentralized approach -  heavily inspired by the [DP-3T](https://github.com/DP-3T/documents) (Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing) and [TCN](https://tcn-coalition.org/) protocols and based on the [Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing specifications](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/) by Apple and Google. Like DP-3T and the TCN Protocol, the apps and backend infrastructure will be entirely open source - licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE)! The apps (for iOS and Android) will collect pseudonymous data from nearby mobile phones using Bluetooth technology. The data will be stored locally on each device preventing access and control over data by authorities or anyone else. We will meet the applicable data protection standards and guarantee a high level of IT security. By doing so, we are addressing people's privacy concerns and thereby aiming to increase the adoption of the app.

## Who we are

The German government has asked SAP and Deutsche Telekom to develop the Corona-Warn-App for Germany as open source software. Deutsche Telekom is providing the network and mobile technology and will operate and run the backend for the app in a safe, scalable and stable manner. SAP is responsible for the app development, its framework and the underlying platform. Therefore, development teams of SAP and Deutsche Telekom are contributing to this project. At the same time our commitment to open source means that we are enabling -in fact encouraging- all interested parties to contribute and become part of its developer community.

## Credits

We'd like to thank all the partners who have been involved in this enormous project from the beginning. The project would not be where it is today without all the exploration and great work that had already been done around the [PEPP-PT](https://www.pepp-pt.org/) approach by partners on a European and national level. We will build on top of some of these components and appreciate how everyone is dedicated to making this new approach successful. Moreover, we would like to thank GitHub for their great support.

## Data Privacy

In this project we are strictly observing the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect the users’ privacy. We are processing necessary data only - exclusively for the purpose to let users know if they have come into close contact with other infected users, without revealing each other's identity. The compliance with these regulations is safeguarded by several procedures, e.g. by implementing technical and organizational measures adhering diligently to the high standards of the GDPR. Of course, the app will provide users with a comprehensive privacy statement to be as transparent and clear as possible. As we are developing the app as an open source project, the community can review it. We appreciate your feedback!

## Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) in version 2.0 as our code of conduct. Please see the details in our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All contributors must abide by the code of conduct.

## Working Language

We are building this application for Germany. We want to be as open and transparent as possible, also to interested parties in the global developer community who do not speak German. Consequently, all content will be made available primarily in _English_. We also ask all interested people to use English as language to create issues, in their code (comments, documentation etc.) and when you send requests to us. The application itself, documentation and all end-user facing content will - of course - be made available in German (and probably other languages as well). We also try to make developer documentation available in German, but please understand that focussing on the _Lingua Franca_ of the global developer community makes the development of this application as efficient as possible.

## Our documentation

This repository contains the developer documentation and related content.

### Project Scope
The project scope has been agreed on jointly by Deutsche Telekom AG and SAP SE as contractors and the German Federal Government and the Robert-Koch-Institut as clients. The project scope might change over time as new requirements need to be included or existing ones change. We appreciate feedback to all elements of this project scope document. However, additional features or any other content changes beyond fixes to grammatical issues or typos need to be aligned on by these partners before they can be included in the document. Thank you for your understanding!
