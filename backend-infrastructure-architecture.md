# German Corona-Warn-App (CWA)

## Backend Infrastructure Architecture Overview

The file ``backend-infrastructure-architecture.pdf`` complements the "CWA Solution Architecture" document. It is intended as a technical overview document of Corona Warn App (CWA) and its underlying infrastructure and network.

This description of the **CWA backend infrastructure architecture** is not published as MD file, because it is not intended to be developed together with the community. Whoever takes the sources and sets up their own "Corona-Warn-App" may use another backend structure. Nevertheless, it might be helpful to know how the current project is implemented in a data center. Therefore, we publish this document as a [PDF](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/blob/master/backend-infrastructure-architecture.pdf) file.
